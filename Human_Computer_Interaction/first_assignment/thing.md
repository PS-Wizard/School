## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Usability

Usability: the degree to which something is able or fit to be used. - Oxford Dictionary

#### What is usability?
The word usability is the measure of how easy and intuitive something is to be used. It is also a concept very prevelant in UI/UX to ensure that products--like websites, native applications or games can be used as painlessly as possible. 

#### Why does it matter?
Usability matters because it is the single most important factor in user satisfication. Jakob Nielsen, one of the most recognized experts in UI/UX, emphasizes that allocating just 10% of a development budget to usability can yield significant returns. On average, **websites that undergo a usability revamp see a 135% imporvements in key performance metrics**.[^1]

#### How to make a website more usable?
Better usability can be acheived by following established frameworks such as:
- [Jakob Nielsen's Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
- [Shneidermanâ€™s Eight Golden Rules](https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/ben/goldenrules.html)
- [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.wcag.com/)

Thus, in a world where there are 1.88 billion websites[^2], and where **the return on investment for UX design can reach 9,900%[^3]**, investing in usability is not just a gimmick but a necessity. A well designed, and user friendly website leads to **higher engagement, better conversion rates and overall user satisfication.** With this stated, the following section 
further explores existing research and studies on usability with a special focus in website usability.

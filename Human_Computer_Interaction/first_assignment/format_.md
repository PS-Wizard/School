# Shneiderman’s 8 Golden Rules of Interface Design
1. **Consistency**: Consistent design ensures that similar operations and elements look and act the same across the interface.
2. **Shortcuts for Expert Users**: Provide accelerators that allow frequent users to perform tasks more efficiently, without detracting from the usability for new users.
3. **Feedback**: Users should receive informative, timely feedback after every action, so they know the result of their interactions.
4. **Error Prevention**: Design the system to minimize the possibility of errors. This includes preventing irreversible actions (like deleting) and confirming actions when necessary.
5. **Reversible Actions**: Provide users with an easy way to undo or redo their actions, minimizing the consequences of user mistakes.
6. **User Control**: Users should feel in control of the interface, able to initiate actions and correct mistakes without feeling trapped.
7. **Minimal Memory Load**: Reduce the amount of information users need to remember by making things visible and easy to recognize.
8. **Aesthetic and Efficient Design**: The interface should be aesthetically pleasing, while also being efficient in supporting the user’s tasks.

# Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics

1. **Visibility of System Status**: The system should always inform users of what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.
2. **Match Between System and the Real World**: The system should speak the user’s language, using familiar concepts and terminology rather than technical jargon.
3. **User Control and Freedom**: Users should have the ability to easily undo or redo actions, and to back out of unintended situations without penalty.
4. **Consistency and Standards**: The design should follow established conventions, ensuring that users don’t need to learn new patterns for every new task.
5. **Error Prevention**: Design interfaces that prevent errors from occurring in the first place. For example, use constraints and validation to avoid invalid inputs.
6. **Recognition Rather than Recall**: Minimize the user’s memory load by making objects, options, and actions visible and easily accessible.
7. **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**: Allow users to tailor the interface and offer shortcuts for expert users to improve efficiency without hindering novice users.
8. **Aesthetic and Minimal Design**: Keep the design visually pleasing and free from unnecessary clutter, allowing users to focus on their tasks.
9. **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors**: Provide clear error messages that explain the problem and suggest a solution or recovery path.
10. **Help and Documentation**: Even though the system should be usable without documentation, help should be readily available when needed.

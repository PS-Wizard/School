NTRODUCTION

    The study investigates redesign proposals as valuable inputs in usability evaluation.
    Usability evaluation techniques help identify user interaction problems in designs.
    Techniques include think-aloud testing and heuristic evaluation for assessing designs.
    Previous research focused on generating problem descriptions, neglecting redesign proposals.
    Problem descriptions can be brief and unclear, complicating understanding for developers.
    Matching usability problems for analysis is challenging and often subjective.
    Wixon criticizes the focus on identifying problems rather than proposing solutions.
    The paper aims to compare usability problems and redesign proposals in systems development.
    The effectiveness of empirical versus inspection techniques in generating redesigns is explored.

RELATED WORK

    Studies advocate for including redesign proposals in usability evaluations.
    Jeffries suggests problem reports should include proposed solutions and justifications.
    Quick fixes in usability reports often lack detail and clarity for developers.
    Current comparisons of evaluation techniques focus on problem identification, not design influence.

EXPERIMENT

    An exploratory study compares developers' assessments of usability problems and redesign proposals.
    The study aims to collect qualitative data on usability issues impacting developers' utility assessments.
    It also compares the effectiveness of inspection and empirical evaluation techniques.

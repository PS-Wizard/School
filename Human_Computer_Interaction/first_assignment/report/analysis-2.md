- High information density in some articles can feel overwhelming. Improving line spacing and word spacing could enhance readability.

Wikipedia does a good job of reducing cognitive load by making content easy to navigate and search. However, enhancing readability with better spacing would make the experience even more user-friendly. While Wikipedia is meant to be packed with information, improving line and word spacing can enhance readability without losing any of that valuable content.

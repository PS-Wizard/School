# Shneidermanâ€™s 8 Golden Rules of Interface Design
- Consistency is key.
- Shortcuts for pros.
- Good Feedback, fast.
- Prevent errors: design so mistakes dont happen. Delete > conformation popups > prevents screwing up
- Easy to reverse actions:  people mess up. make it easy to undo
- User in control 
- Minimal Memory Load
- Efficient & Aesthetic

# Jakob Nielsenâ€™s 10 Usability Heuristics
- Visibility of System Status:  Keep users in loop. Loading? Show progress; Processing? show spinner
- Match Between System & Real World: ditch tech jargon; Speak Human
- User Control & freedom: give escape routes. undo, redo, back buttons 
- Consistency & Standards : Don't Reinvent UI Patterns. 
- Error Prevention: Bet way to fix errors is to simply not let them happen
- Recognition Over Recall
- Flexibility & Effeciency
- Aesthetic & Minimal Design
- Help users Recocnize, Diagnose & Recover from Errors
- Help & Documentation

# Shneiderman & Nielsen's Usability Rules ðŸ”¥  

## Aesthetic & Minimalism  
- **Shneiderman:** Efficient & Aesthetic â€“ Keep it clean, simple, and functional.  
- **Nielsen:** Aesthetic & Minimalist Design â€“ No clutter, every element should serve a purpose.  

## User Control & Freedom  
- **Shneiderman:** User in Control â€“ Let users decide what they want to do, donâ€™t force them.  
- **Nielsen:** User Control & Freedom â€“ Undo, redo, and exit options should always be there.  

## Easy Recovery & Error Handling  
- **Shneiderman:** Easy to Reverse Actions â€“ Undo should be an option at all times.  
- **Nielsen:** Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, & Recover from Errors â€“ Clear error messages, easy fixes.  

## Error Prevention  
- **Shneiderman:** Prevent Errors Like a Pro â€“ Design in a way that avoids mistakes.  
- **Nielsen:** Error Prevention â€“ Best way to fix errors? Make sure they never happen.  

## Reduce Cognitive Load  
- **Shneiderman:** Minimal Memory Load â€“ Users shouldnâ€™t have to remember things, UI should guide them.  
- **Nielsen:** Recognition Over Recall â€“ Show options instead of making users remember.  

## Speed & Efficiency  
- **Shneiderman:** Shortcuts for Pros â€“ Power users need hotkeys and efficiency hacks.  
- **Nielsen:** Flexibility & Efficiency â€“ Adapt for both newbies and pros (shortcuts, automation).  

## Clear Feedback & System Status  
- **Shneiderman:** Good Feedback, Fast â€“ Users should see instant responses to their actions.  
- **Nielsen:** Visibility of System Status â€“ Keep users informed with progress indicators, load spinners, etc.  

## Consistency  
- **Shneiderman:** Consistency is Key â€“ UI elements should be predictable and follow standard conventions.  
- **Nielsen:** Consistency & Standards â€“ Donâ€™t make users guess, follow existing design patterns.

## Unique to Each  

### **Shneiderman Only**  
- **N/A** (Everything maps to Nielsenâ€™s rules)  

### **Nielsen Only**  
- **Match Between System & Real World** â€“ Speak human, not machine. Use familiar icons & language.  
- **Help & Documentation** â€“ If users need help, make it easy to find (searchable docs, FAQs, tooltips).

# Usability Review of Learning Management Platforms

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Usability
- Define usability.
- Reference Jakob Nielsenâ€™s and/or Shneidermanâ€™s principles.
- Discuss how usability applies broadly in web interfaces.

### 1.2 Importance of Usability
- Why does usability matter? (Efficiency, user satisfaction, accessibility, etc.)
- Real-world impacts (e.g., user retention, conversion rates, etc.)
- Reference a study or usability guideline.

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Academic Research on Usability
- Discuss at least **two** usability-related academic journal articles.
- Summarize their key findings.
- Relate these findings to web usability.

### 2.2 Usability in Web Design
- Discuss general web usability best practices.
- Reference established frameworks or guidelines (Nielsen, Shneiderman, WCAG, etc.).

### 2.3 Overview of Selected Learning Management Platforms
- Brief introduction to the **two** learning management systems (LMS) being reviewed.
- Why these platforms were chosen.

## 3. Analysis

### 3.1 Evaluation of Website 1
- **Use a table to compare usability principles** (Shneiderman & Nielsen combined).
- Discuss how well the website meets each principle.
- Provide real-world examples from the website (e.g., "This platform lacks an undo button").
- Discuss any usability issues found.

### 3.2 Evaluation of Website 2
- Same structure as 3.1.
- Compare findings with Website 1.

## 4. Conclusion
- Summarize key findings.
- Which website performed better and why?
- How can these platforms improve usability?

## 5. References

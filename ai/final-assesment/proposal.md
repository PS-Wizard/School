## Classification:
- [ Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/329/diabetic+retinopathy+debrecen) 
    - 1.1k instances
    - 19 features
    - No Missing Values
    - Binary Class Classification

- [ Material Health Risk](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/863/maternal+health+risk)
    - 1k instances
    - No Missing Values
    - Multi Class Classification


- [Diabeties Indicators](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators)
    - No Missing Values
    - 250k instances
    - CDC founded
    - Multi class classification i think?
    - Faced Problem:
        - Too Big Dataset EDA Graphs Are Not Interpretable

- [Obesity Estimation based on eating habits](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition)
    - No Missing Values
    - 2.1k instsances
    - 16 features
    - Could be used for both classification and regression
    - Might just use this?
    - NObeyesdad (obesity level)
        - regression 
        - classification
            - multi class classification



## Regression:

- [Parkinsons] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/189/parkinsons+telemonitoring)

    - ~ 6k higher count good for regression
    - No Missing values
    - Clear target
    - From what i understood from the EDA
        - Scatter plot shoes densly packed plots
        - Not Too Linearaly Correlated with the target variable
            - Not good for linear regression?
                - Models that are better suited for regression for non linear correlation?
                    - Decision tree regression?
                

How can voice features like jitter, shimmer and frequency change act as indicators of how parkinsons affect the vocal system. 
- Target: total_UPDRS

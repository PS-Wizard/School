# Introduction:
Artifical Intelligence (AI) has been a highly trending topic, especially in the past few years, thanks to tools like Chat-GPT and Midjourney; and rightfully so. These AI tools have had a profound impact in the way we do things, especially in the educational sector. Tools like Chat-GPT have become a one-stop-shop for learning and understanding basically any topic. However, with this widespread adoption, comes some serious concerns regarding the use of AI. These concerns fall into 3 categories: **transparency and explanability**, **biasness and descrimination** and **copyright and privacy**.

AI works as black boxes, especially in the case of neural networks. While this may sound simple at first glance, it challenges a fundamental human trait. Humans have the ability to think through a problem, and explain their thought process every step of the way, AI lacks that. This simple inability to explain how it came to a certain conclusion makes it so much harder to justify those answers (Trausan-Matu, 2020, p. 6). This becomes a much greater concern when paired with the conern for accountability. Its not a matter of "if", but "when" an AI makes mistakes, this inability to explain how it came to a conclusion makes it harder to prevent in the future. Furthermore, this calls a need on developers and the creators of the AI to take accountability for the decisions that their AI made, which at present remains absent ([Ubers Self-Driving Car Fatality](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-33347866), [ Amazon's AI Recruiting Tool ](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/insight-amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK0AG/),[COMPAS Algorithm in U.S. Criminal Justice](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing)). Furthermore, a point is to be made on tools like Midjourney. AI produces results based on the data it was trained upon, data collected from **everyone**. So, if AI is using the insights and data from multiple individuals, who actually is to be credited for the results it produces?. These concerns raise ethical questions about the use of AI as it continues to be more embedded in our daily lives. The following sections of this report will attempt to highlight more of these dilemmas and provide possible solutions.

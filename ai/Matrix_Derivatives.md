# Functions

**One-To-One (Injective)**:
Different inputs give different outputs; no 2 people (inputs) will have the same house (output).

**One-To-One and Onto (Bijective):**
If a function is both __one-to-one__ (injective) and __every possible output is covered__ (onto | also called surjective).

**One-To-One and Into:**
If a function is __one-to-one__ (injective) but __not all output is covered__ (not onto).

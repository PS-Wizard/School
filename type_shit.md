### The stuff u actually came for:

Ocean County College (OCC) has specific tuition and financial requirements for international students, categorized as "Out-of-State or foreign residents".
Here's a summary of the tuition fees, estimated costs, housing information, and financial aid options for international students at OCC:



### Tuition and Fees

*   **Per-Semester Hour Costs**:
    *   For **Summer 2025**, the tuition rate for out-of-state or foreign residents is **$275.00 per semester hour**. This rate also applies to e-learning courses for out-of-state residents.
    *   For **Fall 2025**, the tuition rate for out-of-state or foreign residents increases to **$298.00 per semester hour**. This rate also applies to e-learning courses for out-of-state residents.

*   **Course and Material Fees**: In addition to tuition, certain designated courses may require a course or material fee. A special table of fees, not explicitly detailed in the sources, exists for International Education Courses, and an international fee is to be determined for each seminar for Fall 2024. Students may also need to purchase materials for their own use, which are not included on the college bill.

### Total Estimated Cost of Attendance

*   Based on a **2021-2022 rate**, the total estimated cost of attendance for a full-time, full-year international student (15 credits per semester) was **$37,088**, though this rate is subject to change.
    *   This total breaks down as:
        *   Tuition and fees ($270.00 per credit): $8,430 (Note: this is an older per-credit rate than the current published rates).
        *   Supplies: $438.
        *   Miscellaneous: $2,000.
        *   Transportation: $3,360.
        *   Housing/living expenses: $22,860.
*   **Proof of financial capability** to cover these educational and living expenses (currently stated as $37,088) must be demonstrated through documented funds in a bank account or readily convertible assets, translated into US Dollars. If funds are provided by someone other than the student, a **notarized affidavit of financial support** is required, including the sponsor's bank statement, proof of employment, and yearly salary.

### Housing

*   Ocean County College is a **non-residential institution**, meaning **they do not offer housing to students**.
*   International students are responsible for arranging their own room, board, and transportation prior to the start of classes. Proof of an intended local address is required for admission.

### Financial Aid and Scholarships

*   **Eligibility for Employment**: International students holding an F-1 visa are **only eligible for limited on-campus employment**, and these positions are typically reserved for students eligible for financial aid. The primary purpose of an F-1 visa is to study.
*   **Scholarships**:
    *   OCC offers a **variety of academic, need-based, and program-specific scholarships** that students can apply for.    
    *   These scholarships are available to both new and returning students through the Ocean County College Foundation, with amounts potentially ranging **up to $3,000**, and some may be renewed. 
    * The above is pulled from: https://www.ocean.edu/how-to-pay/financial-aid-scholarships/scholarships/
    *   Students typically only need to complete **one online scholarship application** to be automatically considered for most foundation scholarships. They can also "apply" for specific scholarships by providing additional documentation.
    * This is documented: https://ocean.academicworks.com/. 
    *   Examples of available scholarships include the "100 Women Campaign General Scholarship," "100 Women Campaign Health and Social Sciences Scholarship," and "100 Women Campaign STEM Scholarship". Pulled from the same thingy: https://ocean.academicworks.com/. 
    *   It is important to note that a **FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) is not always required** to receive private scholarships or loans. Don't really know what that means but its here if u wana find it:https://www.ocean.edu/how-to-pay/financial-aid-scholarships/types-of-financial-aid/
*   **Payment Methods**: International students can make tuition and fee payments using **Convera** for bank transfers or **Pay My Tuition** for international credit/debit cards or bank transfers. These services provide upfront pricing, payment options, and tracking information.

### Limitations

*   Students on B1 or B2 visas cannot attend classes until their change of visa status is approved, and wait times for visa status changes are not currently published by the government.
*   OCC can only offer I-20s (Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Status) to **full-time, degree-seeking students** and does not offer them for English Language Learning courses.
*   Nursing is not a degree currently offered to international students.
*   International students must adhere to strict deadlines for application, with recommended application at least six months before the start of the semester. For the Fall Semester (September start), the new student deadline is June 1st, and the transfer student deadline is August 15th. For the Spring Semester (January start), the new student deadline is October 1st, and the transfer student deadline is January 3rd.
*   International students must **maintain their immigration status** by fulfilling requirements such as full-time enrollment (at least 12 credits), reporting address or financial support changes, seeking DSO approval for employment or program changes, and keeping their passport valid.
